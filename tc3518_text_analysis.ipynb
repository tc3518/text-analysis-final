        "## 1. Research Question\n",
        "With the advancement of large language models and the widespread use of generative AI tools, some users have begun to view AI models as friends or even romantic partners. As AI companion technologies become increasingly integrated into emotional, relational, and even intimate aspects of daily life, policymakers face new questions about digital well-being, psychological safety, and the ethical governance of human–AI interactions. Public sentiment is a key indicator of emerging regulatory concerns, this study asks: How do YouTube users emotionally respond to AI companionship, and what might these reactions imply for ongoing policy debates around AI safety and regulation on emotional AI."

        "## 2. Literature Review\n",
        "Existing research on AI companions and social robots highlights both their psychological benefits and their ethical dilemma. Meta-analytic evidence demonstrates that social robots can meaningfully reduce loneliness and depressive symptoms by providing emotional support and consistent interaction (Yen et al., 2024). These therapeutic effects suggest that AI companions may serve as accessible tools for individuals experiencing social isolation or psychological distress. Similarly, studies on social robot interventions in mental health contexts show generally positive outcomes, though results vary depending on user characteristics and the specific design of the intervention (Guemghar et al., 2022).\n",
        "However, scholars have also raised concerns about the ethical and social implications of forming intimate bonds with AI agents. Shank, Koike, and Loughnan (2025) argue that emerging forms of “artificial intimacy”, including AI romance and AI companions may create risks such as emotional dependency, distorted expectations of relationships, and the potential exploitation of vulnerable users. They emphasize the need for careful oversight and ethical guidelines as these technologies become more immersive and personalized."

        "## 3. Research Methods\n",
        "This study investigates public sentiment toward AI companion technologies by analyzing YouTube comments from videos discussing various forms of human–AI companionship. Data were collected using the YouTube Data API v3. To capture a broad range of content related to AI companionship, six targeted keyword queries were used: “ai companion,” “ai friendship,” “ai relationship,” “ai romantic relationship,” “ai boyfriend,” and “ai girlfriend.”  For each query, the API returned up to 50 of the most relevant videos based on YouTube’s default relevance-ranking algorithm.For each retrieved video, up to 300 publicly available top-level comments were collected, producing a dataset of user-generated responses reflecting diverse perspectives on AI companions. Non-text elements and non-English comments were removed, as the VADER sentiment analyzer is optimized for English. VADER was then used to compute sentiment scores for each comment, generating a compound value from –1 to +1. Comments were categorized as positive, negative, or neutral using standard thresholds. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to summarize overall sentiment patterns across the dataset."

        "The combination of YouTube API data collection and VADER sentiment analysis is well suited to answering this study’s research question. Because debates surrounding AI companionship unfold largely on public digital platforms, YouTube comments provide an authentic window into spontaneous, user-generated reactions that are difficult to capture through surveys. Using the YouTube API ensures systematic and replicable data collection across multiple keywords associated with AI companionship, while VADER offers an efficient and valid way to quantify emotional tone in large-scale comment datasets. Together, these methods directly fit the goal of mapping real-world public responses to emerging AI companionship."

        "From the bar plots we can observe that the sentiment patterns emerging from the most commented and most viewed videos reveal a public discourse that is highly engaged but emotionally moderate. Among the ten videos with the largest number of comments, sentiment scores cluster around neutral or mildly positive values. The general public's attitude toward AI companions is neutral to slightly positive and extensive comment activity does not necessarily reflect emotional endorsement. From the titles of these videos we can see they often involve debates surrounding ethical risks, societal consequences, or the psychological implications of AI companionship. Such topics draw viewers to share differing perspectives, creating high engagement without producing strongly positive or negative average sentiment. A similar pattern appears in the ten most viewed videos. Despite substantial viewership, these content does not generate moral panic or enthusiasm either. It is worth noting that, judging by their titles, some of the top 10 most-viewed videos appear to have no direct connection to the AI companions explored in this project. Instead, they seem to be funny short videos generated by AI that revolve around the theme of romantic relationships. This inaccuracy is an inherent drawback of API-scraped data.\n"

        "The scatterplot of view count versus sentiment further reinforces the pattern that public sentiment remains neutral across different view counts. There is no clear correlation between public attention and emotional valence: videos with millions of views display sentiment scores similar to those with only a few thousand views. Meanwhile, the majority of data points correspond to a mean greater than zero, with only a few data points falling below the x-axis. This indicates that the public maintains a neutral to slightly positive attitude toward AI companions, and this sentiment does not change based on the popularity of videos or topics."

        "The overall neutral-to-positive public sentiment suggests that users do not currently perceive AI companions as an urgent societal threat, but the high engagement surrounding ethical concerns indicates that the public is actively negotiating the boundaries of acceptable human–AI intimacy. Policymakers should treat this as an early window of opportunity: regulations can be introduced before strong polarization or backlash takes shape. Given that the most discussed videos involve psychological risks, dependency issues, and the potential manipulation of vulnerable users, regulatory frameworks should prioritize transparency, data protection, and safeguards against emotional exploitation."
